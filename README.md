# Segment-Objects-on-a-White-Background

**Problem Statement**

An image of colored objects on a white background is given. The task is to segment out the objects, count the number of colored objects and also count the objects of the same color, i.e., green, blue, yellow and red. There is a white object and a transparent object too in the image. If possible, get these as well.

**Running the Code**

Just run the *hw0.m* file to get the output.

**Result**

The result identifies all the objects. Hard-thresholding has been used to identify these objects.
